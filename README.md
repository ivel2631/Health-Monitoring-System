<h1>IMPLEMENTATION OF AFFORDABLE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY HEALTH MONITORING SENSOR SYSTEM.</h1>

<h2><strong>ABSTRACT </strong></h2>

<h3><i>An implementation of affordable medical technology health monitoring sensor system is developed and demonstrated to measure blood saturation levels (SpO2), heart rate and body temperature simultaneously. The proposed pulse oximetry sensor uses spectrophotometry to calculate the ratio of oxygenated hemoglobin to deoxygenated hemoglobin which then is used to calculate the percentage of oxygenated blood levels.This work has been implemented using an Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller along with this sensor integrated circuit (IC). The system is designed in the Proteus environment and then simulated to check its performance. After that, the hardware implementation is performed. We used a clipping type optical sensor to sense the arterial oxygen saturation level of blood signal from the fingertips of an individual and then transformed it into the digital data in the microcontroller through programming its instruction and display the obtained results on an LCD. The low cost embedded sensor system reported in this study can be used to monitor key health parameters of patients in hospitals or at home. The measured health parameters are compared with commercially available Pulse Oximeter and a maximum deviation of 2% is observed which demonstrates that the proposed sensor device is highly accurate.</h3></i>
